Approach:

Use a dummy node to traverse levels:

We can use a dummy node to help in linking all the nodes on the current level.
This dummy node will have its next pointer move across all nodes on the current level, and then we can use this setup to connect nodes at the next level.

Level Order Traversal (without extra space):

Start with the root node and initialize a current pointer that will move across the current level.
For each node in the current level:
Connect the left child (if it exists) to the next available position using the dummy node.
Connect the right child (if it exists) similarly.
Move to the next node in the current level using the next pointer.
Once the level is complete, move to the next level by setting the current pointer to the dummy nodeâ€™s next pointer (which now points to the first node in the next level).
Reset the dummy node for the next iteration.

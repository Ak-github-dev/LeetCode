Key Insights:
Initial Pairing:

Since both nums1 and nums2 are sorted, the smallest possible sum pair is (nums1[0], nums2[0]).
The next smallest pair will either include nums1[0] with nums2[1], or nums1[1] with nums2[0].
Using a Min-Heap:

We can use a min-heap to always extract the smallest sum pair.
We initialize the heap with pairs combining nums1[0] with every element in nums2 (up to k elements, as there's no need to add more pairs initially than k).
For each extracted pair (i, j), we push the next potential pair (i+1, j) if it hasnâ€™t been considered yet.
Efficiency:

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the k smallest pairs without generating all possible pairs, which would be infeasible given the constraints.
